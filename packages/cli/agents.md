# CLI Agent Instructions

## Docs sync

This README (`README.md`) is the source of truth for CLI commands, schemas, flags, and behavior. The public documentation page lives at `apps/web/src/app/docs/page.tsx`.

- When you add or change commands, flags, schemas, or behavior in the CLI, update this README first.
- Then update the web docs page at `apps/web/src/app/docs/page.tsx` to reflect the same changes.
- The web docs page reformats README content into cards, tables, code blocks with copy buttons, and sidebar navigation.

Always keep both in sync.
